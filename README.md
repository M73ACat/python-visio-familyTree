# python-visio-familyTree
Build a simple family tree by operating on Visio via python and win32com.

'familyTree.py' is the main program, which manipulates the "source.vsdx" file to generate "familyTree.vsdx" by getting information from the xlsx file.

More information including some introduction to visio operation via win32com can be found at https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/626351236.
